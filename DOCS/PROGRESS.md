- Improved thumbs up confirmation: Now overlays the Capture Image button with graffiti effect and animation.
- Renamed ds page and route to design-studio, updated all references and navigation links.
- Added 'Locations' link to navbar and footer after Design Studio, visible on all menus.
- Created Locations page with embedded Google Map previews and all provided coordinates.
- Added icons to all navbar links (desktop and mobile).
- Added Copy and Share buttons to each location card on Locations page.
- Fixed Locations page to be a Client Component by adding 'use client' directive.
